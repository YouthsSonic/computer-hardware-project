<h1> Hardware Terminology</h1>

<h3> Input Device </h3>
<p>An input device is an device used to give a computer signals. Some examples of an input device is an keyboard, mouse or even a pen.</p>

<h3> Output Device </h3>
<p>An output device is a peice of computer hardware that converts 1s and 0s into informaation humans can read. Some examples of an input device is a colored display or monitor.</p>

<h3>Central Processing Unit</h3>
<p>A central proccesing unit which is also known as a CPU is a peice of computer hardware that carries out instructions given to it.</p>

<h3>Arethmetic Logic Unit</h3>
<p> An arethemetic logic unit which is also known as an ALU is an digital that is typically used to do aresthmetic fuctions.</p>

<h3>Control Unit</h3>
<p>An control unit also known as a CU is a part in a computers CPU. The CU manages the operation of the CPUS processor. It also tells it how to react to instructions that were sent to the CPU.</p>

<h3>Random Access Memory</h3>
<p>Random acess memory is a short term type of computer memory. Random access memory is also known as RAM for short. RAM usually works with the computers direct access memory.</p>

<h3>Optical Memory</H3>
<p>Optical storage stores data on a physical disk by making marks in it so the computer can read it. Optical Memory looks a lot like an CD.</p>

<h3>Magnetic Memory</h3>
<p>Magnetic memory uses magnets to store data on a computer. It uses multiple patterns of magntisation to store data.</p>


<h3>Flash Memory</h3>
<p>Flash memory is an electronic form of storing computer memory.There are two main types of flash memroy one of them is NAND falsh and the other one is NOR flash.</P>

<h3> Logic Gates </h3>

<p>Logic gates are the foundation of all digital systems.Logic gates are an electronic circuits that have one or more than one input.</p>
